mlrVST TODO /IDEAS

SHORT TERM
==========
- PatternStripControls (cache pattern as array of rectangles, may need ChangeListeners)
- Sort out monome size (so isn't hardcoded anywhere). Might try grids to click on


LONG TERM
=========

HIGH PRIORTIY

- preset system polish
- OSC mappings for each SampleStrip or Global Setting e.g. /osc/mlrvst/strip/1/vol inc 0.1
- handle different sample rates
- exception handling (if file is deleted while playing)
- add SplashScreen
- allow MIDI clips too
- Have AudioSample subclass Sample to allow MIDISample
- arpeggio mode, hold down button sequence to trigger blocks in that order
- could include envelopes for sample playback

LOW PRIORTIY

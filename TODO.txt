HIGH PRIORTIY

- changing channel while playing leads to crash
- preset system
- (advanced) options panel
	- could include envelopes for sample playback
- handle different sample rates
- exception handling (if file is deleted while playing)
- add SplashScreen
- Allow MIDI clips too
	- Have AudioSample subclass Sample to allow MIDISample
- arpeggio mode, hold down button sequence to trigger blocks in that order
